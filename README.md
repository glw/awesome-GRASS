Awesome G.R.A.S.S. (Geographic Resources Analysis Support System) resources

## [GRASS GIS](https://grass.osgeo.org/)
Commonly referred to as GRASS (Geographic Resources Analysis Support System), is a free and open source Geographic Information System (GIS) software suite used for geospatial data management and analysis, image processing, graphics and maps production, spatial modeling, and visualization. GRASS GIS is currently used in academic and commercial settings around the world, as well as by many governmental agencies and environmental consulting companies. It is a founding member of the [Open Source Geospatial Foundation](https://www.osgeo.org/) (OSGeo).

## Tutorials

* [Processing lidar and UAV point clouds in GRASS GIS](https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Processing_lidar_and_UAV_point_clouds_in_GRASS_GIS_(workshop_at_FOSS4G_Boston_2017)) - Workshop at FOSS4G Boston 2017, "...explore the properties of the point cloud, interpolate surfaces, and perform advanced terrain analyses to detect landforms and artifacts..."

* [grass-gis-mybinder-notebooks](https://github.com/wenzeslaus/grass-gis-mybinder-notebooks) - Jupyer Notebooks for GRASS GIS

<a name="projects" />

## Projects

* [Actinia - GRASS GIS REST API](https://github.com/mundialis/actinia_core) - "It provides a REST API to process satellite images, time series of satellite images, arbitrary raster data with geographical relations and vector data. The REST interface allows to access, manage and manipulate the GRASS GIS database via HTTP GET, PUT, POST and DELETE requests and to process raster, vector and time series data located in a persistent GRASS GIS database..."

* [g.remote](https://github.com/wenzeslaus/g.remote) - GRASS GIS module for executing scripts on a remote server.

<a name="addons" />

## Addon Tools

* [Developing custom GRASS tools](https://github.com/wenzeslaus/foss4g-2022-developing-custom-grass-tools) - This is a set of Jupyter Notebooks for a workshop at FOSS4G 2022. The workshop was created for development version of 8.3 and works with 8.2, too.

* [How to write a Python GRASS GIS 7 addon](https://github.com/wenzeslaus/python-grass-addon) - FOSS4G Europe 2015 workshop, "...what if the tool you are looking for is not present in GRASS GIS? So, simply create your own..."

* [r.valley.bottom](https://github.com/hellik/r.valley.bottom) - calculates a Multi-resolution Valley Bottom Flatness (MrVBF) index.

* [v.sites.cont, v.edges.cont, v.streams.netid](https://github.com/johnDorian/grass_addons) - v.sites.cont, v.edges.cont, v.streams.netid are mainly designed to be used in conjunction with the r.stream to create stream spatial networks to be used with the R SSN package.

* [GSFLOW-GRASS](https://github.com/UMN-Hydro/GSFLOW-GRASS) - GSFLOW is the US Geological Survey's combined groundwater (MODFLOW) and surface water (PRMS) model. GSFLOW-GRASS builds a stream network and its "hydrologic response units" -- here, watershed sub-basins -- that combine to form a surface-water hydrologic network (PRMS). It then links these to a regular finite difference grid to compute groundwater flow using MODFLOW.
